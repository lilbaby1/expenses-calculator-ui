# Roommate Expense Calculator

The Roommate Expense Tracker is a user-friendly React app designed to simplify expense calculations and budget tracking for people living together as roommates. It offers a convenient solution for managing shared expenses, accommodating varying spending habits, and ensuring fair contributions from each roommate.

<b>This is first version of the app with a minimum amount of features. More features to come, including REST API for user registration and authentication.</b>

# Key Features:

Shared Expense Management:
Roommates can input their expenses, detailing how much money they have spent during a specified time frame. This includes both shared purchases and individual purchases.

Customized Expense Allocation:
The app recognizes that roommates may have different preferences and consumption patterns. Users can indicate how much of their expenses are dedicated to their individual preferences, such as specific products or items.

Equal Shared Expenses:
In situations where two or more roommates have made equal contributions for products that are used by at least one roommate, the app can accurately calculate and account for these shared expenses.

Transparent and Fair Calculations:
The Roommate Expense Tracker handles complex calculations and ensures fair distribution of expenses based on individual spending and shared costs. It eliminates the need for manual calculations and potential conflicts over uneven expenses.

Real-Time Updates:
The app updates expense records in real-time, allowing roommates to track their budget and financial status at any given moment.

Multi-Roommate Support:
The app supports multiple roommates, making it ideal for households with more than two members. Each roommate can input their expenses and preferences independently.

User-Friendly Interface:
With an intuitive user interface, the Roommate Expense Tracker is easy to navigate, making it accessible to users of all tech skill levels.

# Benefits:

Simplified Expense Management: The app streamlines the process of recording and calculating expenses, saving users time and effort.

Clear Financial Picture: Roommates gain a transparent view of their collective spending habits, helping them make informed decisions and budget effectively.

Equitable Contributions: By considering individual preferences and shared expenses, the app promotes fair financial participation among roommates.
